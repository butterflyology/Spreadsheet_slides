## 2. Formatting data in spreadsheets

Learning objectives:

* Describe **best practices** for recording and formatting data in spreadsheets
* Understand the correspondance between columns and rows in spreadsheets and data structure
* Understand the correspondance between spreadsheet cells, columns and rows and data observations and values


## The most common mistake

The most common mistake made is treating the program like it is a lab notebook - that is, relying on **context**, notes in the margin, spatial layout of data and fields to convey information. As humans, we can (usually) interpret these things, but computers are dumb, and unless we explain to the computer what every single thing means (and that can be hard!), it will not be able to see how our data fit together.

It is extremely important to set up **well-formatted tables** from the outset - before you even start entering data from your very first preliminary experiment. **Data organization is the foundation of your research project**. It can make it easier or harder to work with your data throughout your analysis, so it's worth thinking about when you're doing your data entry or setting up your experiment. 

## Keeping track of your analyses
When you're working with spreadsheets, during data clean up or analyses, it's very easy to end up with a spreadsheet that looks very different from the one you started with. In order to be able to reproduce your analyses or figure out what you did when Reviewer #3 asks for a different analysis, *you must*:

* *create a new file or tab with your cleaned or analyzed data*. Do not modify that original dataset, or you will never know where you started!
* *keep track of the steps you took in your clean up or analysis*. You should track these steps as you would any step in an experiment. You should do this in another text file, not in a spreadsheet.


## Structuring data in spreadsheets

The cardinal rules of using spreadsheet programs for data:

1. Put all your **variables in columns** - the thing you're measuring,
   like 'weight' or 'temperature'.
1. Put each **observation in its own row**.
1. **One datum per cell**, the "tidy data" principle.
1. **Leave the raw data raw** - don't mess with it!
1. Export the cleaned data to a **text based format** like **.csv**. This ensures that anyone can use the data, and is the format required by most data repositories.


## Messy data
What are the issues with this example?

## Tidy data
When setting up a spreadsheet:

* **columns = variables**
* **rows = observations**
* **cells = data (values)**.

So, instead we should have:

## Exercise
The data we will use for this lesson are available here:

[Lesson data](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2252083) 

* **Downlaod the data**
* **Open the data in a spreadsheet program**


## Exercise
* Two field assistants conducted the surveys, one in 2013 and one in 2014; both kept track of the data in their own way. You are now in charge of this project and you want to be able to begin analyzing the data.

* With the person next to you, work on the messy data so that a computer will be able to understand it. Clean up the 2013 and 2014 tabs, and put them all together in one spreadsheet.


## Exercise
**Important**, Do not forget our first piece of advice, the **create a new file (or tab)** for the cleaned data, **never modify the original (raw) data**.

After you go through this exercise, we'll discuss as a group what you think was wrong with this data and how you fixed it.
